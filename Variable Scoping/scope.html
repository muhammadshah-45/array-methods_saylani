        <h1>Variable Scoping</h1>
        <p>Variable scoping refers to the visibility or accessibility of variables in certain parts of your code during runtime. It determines where a variable can be accessed or modified and is an essential concept in programming languages, particularly in JavaScript.

            In JavaScript, variable scope can be divided mainly into three categories: global scope, function scope, and block scope.
            
            Global Scope:
            Variables declared outside any function or block are in the global scope. They can be accessed from anywhere in your code, including inside functions.</p>
